Muslim scholars and Sufi religious mystics and saints migrated to India from Iran, Turkey, and Central Asia. Some came in search of government jobs, others for new cultural opportunities, to study, or to spread their own beliefs. Some of the best poets immigrated from Persia.

Similarly, imperial court painters, who produced masterpieces in the Persian and Mughal miniature styles, interacted with painters of the Rajput schools in local Hindu courts across north India, resulting in artistic innovations in both. On the level of mystical belief and experience, an astonishing syncretism emerged between Hindus and Muslims, especially in the poetry of Kabir [died circa 1520] and of Guru Nanak (1469–1538), the originator of the Sikh religion. Mystics in the two communities, Hindu bhakti (devotional) worshippers and Muslim Sufis, frequently had warm personal relations and often attracted followers from each others’ communities.`,source:"Howard Spodek and Michele Langford Louro, United States historians, article published in a scholarly journal, 2007"},parts:["Identify ONE claim that the authors make in the first paragraph.","Identify ONE piece of evidence that the authors use to support their claims about cultural interactions between Hindus and Muslims as described in the second paragraph.","Explain ONE reason why Mughal rulers in the period circa 1450–1750 would have encouraged the interactions described in the passage."]},{context:{type:"image",title:"Election Poster for the German National Socialist Party, 1932",description:"The German text in the poster reads, “Men!
